            <h2>Calgary</h2>
            <p>
                Calgary, city, southern Alberta, Canada. The physical setting of Calgary distinguishes 
                it from other cities of the Prairie Provinces. It is situated on the western edge of 
                the Great Plains, in the foothills of the spectacular Canadian Rockies 
                (about 60 miles [100 km] to the west), and the surrounding valleys and uplands are
                a distinct change from the flat prairie landscapes typical of the region. 
                A relatively young Canadian city, it is the administrative and financial headquarters 
                of the country’s petroleum industry. Calgary also celebrates its history as a 
                cattle-ranching capital, an image enhanced by the city’s hosting of the annual 
                Calgary Stampede, a 10-day rodeo-centred event. In the early 21st century, 
                Calgary was one of the fastest-growing cities in Canada. Area 319 square miles 
                (825 square km); metro. area, 1,972 square miles (5,108 square km). 
                Pop. (2011) 1,096,833; metro. area, 1,214,839; (2016) 1,239,220; metro. area, 1,392,609.<br><br>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>In 1875 a North-West Mounted Police (later Royal Canadian Mounted Police) 
                post known unofficially as Fort Brisebois was founded on the site of present-day Calgary. 
                The following year it was officially named Fort Calgary for a town on the Scottish island of Mull. 
                The main duty of the police was to bring order to the illegal whiskey trade in the region. 
                In 1877 the British and Canadian governments signed a peace agreement (Treaty 7) 
                with a number of First Nations (Native American) peoples, and the region rapidly 
                converted to a cattle-ranching frontier.
            <br><br>
                Calgary’s growth and development were more directly related, however, 
                to its selection as one of the stops along the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), 
                Canada’s first nationwide railway. It linked Calgary to central and eastern 
                Canada (1883) and to Vancouver (1886) on the west coast.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
            <br><br>
                Calgary was incorporated as a town in 1884 and as a city 10 years later, 
                prior to the creation of the province of Alberta (1905). In 1884 it had only 
                a few hundred settlers, but by the 1891 census its population had grown to 3,876. 
                In 1891, after a number of false starts by other companies, the Calgary and 
                Edmonton Railway Company completed a rail connection between the two towns and 
                leased the line to the CPR. The CPR was a major landowner and developer within 
                Calgary as well as a promoter of the vast blocks of agricultural land it owned 
                in the surrounding region. The company was also among a number of private investors 
                in the irrigation of farmland in the early 20th century, which greatly lessened 
                the risk of drought and brought in thousands of farmers, thus leading to the 
                expansion of Calgary’s role as a service centre.
            <br><br>
                With its farming community and railway connections in place, it was not long 
                before Calgary became the main shipping centre for the cattle industry, 
                with stockyards (some of them owned by the CPR), slaughterhouses, tanneries, 
                and meat-processing plants. These early commercial and industrial ventures 
                gained Calgary a lasting reputation as a “cow town.” By the early 1900s other 
                rail lines radiated from Calgary, including a connection to the Canadian National Railway, 
                solidifying its position as a provincial transportation centre.
            <br><br>
                The discovery of natural gas at nearby Turner Valley (1914) spurred a new wave of growth, 
                centred on petroleum, particularly after Alberta’s first refinery opened in 1923. 
                Three years after the discovery of crude oil in those fields (1936), 
                a second refinery was built. These early investments and the location there 
                of head offices of petroleum companies and related industries—such as 
                those dealing with surveying, drill rigs and equipment, transportation, 
                and pipelines—cemented Calgary’s role as the business centre of the petroleum industry. 
                The discovery of the well-known Leduc fields near Edmonton (1947) greatly 
                stimulated the city’s economic expansion as well, although, over time, 
                Edmonton would become the headquarters for oil refining, equipment supply, 
                and the servicing of oil fields.<br><br>
